How to read Input files:
In each task folders, there exist multiple experiment set folders.
An experiment set folder is named in the following convention:

- R1_X2_M_C2
- R2_Y1_T2_N3

* The first element is the radius set. R1 means radius set 1.

* The second element is an auxiliary metric. It can be informed agent percentage in the Rally task
for instance.

* The third element is the communication model.

* The last element is the number of agents and their distribution. N12 means 12 agents, C4 means 4th cluster set. A cluster set is defined in the following fashion:

C1 = {4 4 4 2} --> 3 groups of 4 agents and a group of 2 agents.
