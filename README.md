# Robotarium-Swarms
Swarm robotics experiments on the Robotarium Simulator. A swarm of robots follow bioinspired movement patterns to perform various tasks. 


Current swarming tasks include:

Avoid Adversary: A swarm of robots tries to avoid an incoming adversary while maintaining cohesion.

Search for Multiple Targets: A swarm of robots searches for multiple targets randomly scattered in the environment.

Go to Goal: A target is given to the swarm to travel to.

Search for a Goal: The swarm searches for a goal. As one swarm member locates the goal, it propagates the information to its neighbors. 

Rally: The swarm travels to a rally point under the guidance of select agents with knowledge of the rally point.
